/**
 * Singleton class for the greeter theme heartbeat.
 *
 * Once instantiated, the instance will begin sending a heartbeat message to the greeter
 * every 5 seconds. Upon receiving the first heartbeat message, the greeter will schedule checks
 * to ensure that subsequent heartbeat messages are received.
 *
 * If a heartbeat message is not received by the time any of the greeter's
 * subsequent checks run, it will assume that there has been an error in the theme's script
 * execution and fall back to the simple theme.
